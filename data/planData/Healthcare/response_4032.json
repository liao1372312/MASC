"user_query":"My friend is planning a backpacking trip across multiple countries and needs to know which vaccinations are required for each country. Can you provide a list of recommended vaccinations for each country? Additionally, they would like to calculate the carbon footprint of their car travel between cities using the distance of 200 km and a medium diesel car. Lastly, they are curious about the air quality health index based on ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter levels in their current location.",
