"user_query":"I'm planning a vacation to Bali and I want to make sure I have all the necessary vaccinations. Can you provide me with a list of all the recommended vaccinations for traveling to Bali? Also, calculate the carbon footprint of my flight from Los Angeles to Bali and the equivalent number of trees needed to offset it. Lastly, I'm curious about the nutritional analysis of a traditional Balinese dish called Nasi Goreng. Can you provide me with the nutrition data for this dish?",
